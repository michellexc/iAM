    The "i am" Project is a data visualization project that encourages people to think 
    about how they are perceived by others, how they perceive themselves, and challenge 
    how they assume characteristics or qualities about others. <br><br>On the "project" page
    you can view a collection of self submitted responses that reflect an individual's
self perception and the assumptions they have heard about themselves. <br><br>We are all multifaceted 
and have many qualities beneath the surface that make who "i am". Feel free to submit 
your own response through the "submit" page that may be added to the website at a later date.
